PREPARED REMARKS
================================================================================

Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I will now turn the call over to Leslie Bazos, Head of Investor Relations.

Leslie Bazos: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, Ted Pick, our CEO, will provide a strategic overview, and Sharon Yeshaya, our CFO, will review the financial results. During today's presentation we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, both available at morganstanley.com. This presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance.

Ted Pick: Thank you, Leslie, and good morning everyone. Morgan Stanley delivered an outstanding fourth quarter, capping what I believe is a transformational year for the firm. We reported fourth quarter net revenues of $16.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.63, bringing full-year 2025 EPS to $10.21. Full-year revenues exceeded $61 billion, a record for the firm.

Institutional Securities generated revenues of $7.5 billion in the quarter, driven by robust activity across equities, fixed income, and investment banking. Our integrated investment bank continues to win share in a recovering M&A market. Equity underwriting revenues were notably strong, up 45% year-over-year, as IPO activity rebounded significantly.

Wealth Management delivered record revenues of $7.3 billion. Total client assets reached $7.3 trillion, and fee-based asset flows were $36 billion in the quarter. The integration of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance continues to drive operating leverage, and we see meaningful runway ahead as we deepen relationships across our advisor and workplace channels.

Investment Management revenues were $1.6 billion, benefiting from higher AUM on strong market appreciation and positive net flows.

On capital, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $2.5 billion in share repurchases. Our CET1 ratio stands at 15.2%, well above our regulatory minimum, and we expect to continue returning excess capital at an attractive pace.

Looking ahead to 2026, the operating environment is supportive. We see a constructive backdrop for M&A and capital markets, continued asset gathering momentum in Wealth Management, and opportunities to drive further efficiency. Having achieved our 30% pretax margin target in Wealth Management, we are now focused on sustaining and expanding beyond that. Our full-year ROTCE of 21.6% exceeded our 20% target, and we intend to sustain that level.

Sharon, over to you.

Sharon Yeshaya: Thank you, Ted. Good morning. Let me walk through the details.

Fourth quarter firm revenues were $16.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Compensation expense was $6.6 billion, resulting in a compensation ratio of 40.5%. Non-compensation expenses were $3.7 billion, up modestly on higher technology spend. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.5%, and pretax profit was $5.9 billion.

In Institutional Securities, net revenues of $7.5 billion were up 22% year-over-year. Equity sales and trading revenues were $3.1 billion, up 17%, reflecting strong performance in derivatives and prime brokerage. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were $2.1 billion, up 12%, driven by credit and macro products. Investment banking revenues were $2.3 billion, with advisory revenues of $950 million, reflecting the continued M&A recovery.

Total S&T revenues of $5.2 billion were the second highest quarter on record. Total banking and advisory revenues of $2.3 billion reflect the beginning of what we believe will be a multi-year capital markets recovery.

In Wealth Management, revenues of $7.3 billion were up 11% year-over-year. Pretax margin was 30.2%, marking the second consecutive quarter above our 30% target. Fee-based revenues benefited from higher asset levels, and transactional revenues were supported by increased client engagement. Net new assets were $102 billion for the full year 2025.

Investment Management revenues of $1.6 billion were up 8%, driven by higher average AUM of $1.55 trillion. Performance-based revenues were also constructive.

The firm's tax rate was 22% for the quarter. Book value per share rose to $62.45, and tangible book value per share increased to $48.20. ROTCE for the quarter was 23.6%, and for the full year was 21.6%.

We will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
================================================================================

Operator: Our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Mike Mayo: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the results. My question is on the Wealth Management margin sustainability. You printed 30.2% this quarter, hitting the target for the second straight quarter. But I want to understand how durable this is. How much of the margin expansion is structural versus market-driven? And now that you've hit 30%, where is the next goalpost — should we be thinking 33%, 35%?

Sharon Yeshaya: Thanks, Mike. We're very pleased with the margin progression. To your question about durability — a meaningful portion is structural. The fee-based revenue mix continues to shift higher, which carries better margins. The E*TRADE integration synergies are now fully realized, and we've optimized the advisor support model. Is there a component tied to market levels? Of course — higher markets drive higher fee-based revenues on existing assets. But even in a flat market scenario, we believe 30% is sustainable given our cost discipline and scale. As for the next goalpost, we're not putting a specific number out there today, but we believe there is potential to expand margins further over the medium term as we deepen wallet share per advisor and grow the workplace channel.

Mike Mayo: And as a follow-up, on capital returns — you bought back $2.5 billion this quarter. Your CET1 is at 15.2%, well above the minimum. How should we think about the pace of buybacks in 2026? Is there an acceleration case, especially if the Basel III endgame rules continue to be softened?

Ted Pick: Mike, great question. We are in a very strong capital position, and returning capital to shareholders is a priority. The pace of buybacks will depend on several factors — organic growth opportunities, the regulatory landscape, and our confidence in the earnings trajectory. That said, you're right that the direction of Basel III endgame has been constructive, and if the final rules come in as proposed, it could free up additional capital. We intend to be opportunistic and return capital aggressively while maintaining our fortress balance sheet. I think you'll see us at least maintain this pace, with upside if conditions allow.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with BMO Capital Markets.

Brennan Hawken: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the ISG results. The equity trading revenues of $3.1 billion were quite strong. Can you break down how much of that was driven by derivatives versus cash equities versus prime brokerage? And is this level of performance sustainable, or were there one-time items?

Sharon Yeshaya: Brennan, the strength in equities was broad-based. Derivatives had a particularly strong quarter given elevated volatility around year-end and client repositioning. Prime brokerage balances continued to grow as hedge fund clients consolidated with us. Cash equities benefited from higher volumes. I would characterize the quarter as a strong but not anomalous environment — it reflects the structural market share gains we've been making. Is every quarter going to be $3.1 billion? Market conditions will dictate that. But the underlying franchise is bigger and more diversified than it was even two years ago.

Brennan Hawken: Got it. And on the investment banking pipeline — you mentioned M&A recovery. Can you characterize the pipeline heading into 2026 versus a year ago?

Ted Pick: The pipeline is robust — I'd say materially stronger than a year ago. We're seeing increased sponsor activity, strategic dialogues are picking up, and cross-border M&A is a growing part of the mix. The regulatory environment is also becoming more supportive for transactions. The backlog gives us confidence in the first half of 2026, and the new mandate activity suggests this recovery has legs.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Chubak: Good morning. I wanted to ask about deposit trends in Wealth Management. We've seen some stabilization industry-wide, but are you seeing net inflows into deposits now, and how does the sweep deposit repricing impact NII going forward?

Sharon Yeshaya: Steven, deposit trends have stabilized meaningfully. We saw modest net inflows in Q4, which is encouraging after the migration we experienced in 2023 and early 2024. The sweep repricing has been a headwind, as you know, but we believe the worst is behind us. As we look at 2026, we expect NII in Wealth Management to be roughly stable to slightly up, as the benefit of higher asset levels and reinvestment of maturing fixed-rate assets offsets ongoing pricing normalization.

Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

Glenn Schorr: Thanks very much. Ted, I wanted to ask a bigger-picture question. You've been in the seat for about two years now. The stock is up significantly. When you think about the strategic priorities for the next two to three years, what's the biggest opportunity you see that the market isn't fully appreciating?

Ted Pick: Glenn, thank you for the question. I think the biggest underappreciated opportunity is the depth of our Wealth Management platform and its ability to deliver integrated solutions. We have $7.3 trillion in client assets, and we're still in the early innings of cross-selling investment management products, lending solutions, and workplace financial wellness programs into that base. The revenue per advisor metric has significant room to grow. On the institutional side, the convergence of public and private markets creates opportunities for us given our positioning in both traditional investment banking and alternative capital formation. That's a secular trend, not a cyclical one.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Mike Mayo: Thank you for the follow-up. I want to push back a little on the efficiency ratio. You came in at 63.5% this quarter. You've talked about getting to the low 60s or below. But non-comp expenses keep ticking up — technology spending, compliance costs. What's the realistic path to a sub-60% efficiency ratio? And are you willing to make harder choices on headcount or real estate to get there?

Sharon Yeshaya: Mike, fair pushback. A few points. First, the technology spend is an investment, not just a cost — we're building digital capabilities that will drive future efficiency. Second, we are making hard choices. We've reduced our physical footprint by over 15% since 2023, and headcount in support functions has come down. Third, the path to a lower efficiency ratio is primarily through revenue growth on a more scaled platform, not through cutting to the bone. We believe low 60s is achievable in the near term, and sub-60 is a medium-term aspiration as Wealth Management margins expand and ISG operating leverage improves. But I want to be clear — we won't sacrifice investment in the franchise for short-term efficiency gains.

Ted Pick: And Mike, I'd just add — we're very focused on this. It's a priority in our management discussions. The firm's scale today is different than five years ago. We should be operating more efficiently, and we will.

Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Leslie Bazos for closing remarks.

Leslie Bazos: Thank you all for joining us today. If you have follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. Have a good day.

Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
